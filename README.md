# Data-Collection-Billboard-Spotify-CS479
This data collection proposal is driven by the question: “What traits do popular songs share?”. The music industry could benefit financially from doing statistical analysis on Spotify and Billboard Hot 100 data (Spotify, 2020; The Hot 100, 2020). Using simple python scripts to scrape the song titles of the Billboard Hot 100, and using Spotify’s python API, I can obtain data such as the song titles, artists, song duration, and genre of the most popular music (Spotipy, 2020; Billboard Hot 100 Web Scraper, 2020). Using this data, I can begin to investigate questions such as: What is the most popular genre? What is the most popular length? I can also explore possible similarities amongst successful songs. These findings could help influence music creators to produce more profitable music. 

This idea was inspired by the work of Sean Miller who collected data about songs in the hot 100 from 8/2/1958 and 12/28/2019 (Miller, 2020). I will be generating a data set by pulling data from already existing data sources: Billboard’s Hot 100 and Spotify’s internal database. This dataset will be a mix of qualitative and quantitative data about popular music tracks. From there I can investigate the characteristics of successful music.
